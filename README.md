## TiKV is a distributed KV database powered by Rust.


TiKV is inspired by the design of Google Spanner and HBase, but much simpler (Doesn't depend on any distributed file system).

- __Geo-Replication__  
TiKV uses Raft to support Geo-Replication. We have ported etcd's raft implementation to Rust.


- __Horizontal scalability__  


- __Consistent distributed transactions__  


- __Coprocessor support__  


- __Works with TiDB__
